<h1>TODO Application</h1>
<h2>CSC 4996 First Project Developed by Daoud Sleiman</h2>

<h3>How to run on Windows 10:</h3>

<p>
1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.<br/>
2. Download XAMPP for your correct operating system (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).<br/>
Here is a tutorial on how to install XAMPP and get Apache and MySQL running on Windows 10:<br/>

Here is a link to FAQ about XAMPP: <br/>
https://www.apachefriends.org/faq_windows.html <br/>
3. After XAMPP has finished installing, open it (Make sure to run as administrator to avoid problems).<br/>
4. In the XAMPP Control Panel, click on the explorer button.<br/>
5. Navigate to the htdocs folder.<br/>
6. Create a folder called todo.<br/>
7. Extract the zip on your desktop and navigate one directory in (folder path with the word docs inside of it).<br/>
8. Drag all the files into the todo folder you created.<br/>
9. Make sure in your XAMPP Control Panel that Apache and MySQL are started and are green. If Apache doesn't start,
try clicking the green checkmark until it becomes a red x, and then click it again. This will uninstall and reinstall Apache.<br/>
10. After both Apache and MySQL are running, go to a web browser and type "localhost:80/todo/deployment/script.php". This will run 
the deployment script that will create all the necessary tables for you to use this application. <br/>
11. After running the script, click the Home button and you will be directed to the main page.<br/>

Congrats, you're now ready to use the TODO Application!
